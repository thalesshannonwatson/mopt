\description{
loads a mopt config from file. This is very useful
for on-the-fly analysis of results that are generated
on a remote machine, or to process results on your local machine.
Fetching remote files requires a publickey authentication setup
for ssh to the remote server. your connetion must
work without having to type a password. It's easy
to setup the ssh-agent and add a passphrase to an existing
key. Preferably set up a config file for ssh. see the references.
